OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: Developing a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

The IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis project aims to automatically classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, the project transforms raw text data into actionable insights by following a structured approach.

Core Objectives:

Sentiment Classification: Accurately predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.

Text Cleaning: Preprocess review text to remove noise and improve model accuracy.

Balanced Learning: Address class imbalance to ensure fair and unbiased predictions.

Performance Measurement: Evaluate the model using robust metrics to ensure reliability.

Key Activities:

Data Preparation: Load and clean the IMDb movie reviews dataset, handling any inconsistencies and converting the sentiment labels to binary form.

Text Preprocessing: Apply NLP techniques—such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization—to standardize and simplify the review text.

Feature Extraction: Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into numerical features that the model can interpret.

Class Imbalance Handling: Use oversampling methods to ensure the model learns equally from both positive and negative reviews.

Model Training: Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, well-suited for text classification, on the processed and balanced dataset.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a confusion matrix for detailed insights.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language for implementing the solution.

Pandas, NumPy: Tools for data handling and manipulation.

NLTK: Library for text processing tasks like tokenization and lemmatization.

Scikit-learn: Framework for machine learning and model evaluation.

Imbalanced-learn: Used to address class imbalance issues.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Libraries for visualizing model performance and data characteristics.

Conclusion:

This project effectively transforms IMDb movie reviews into binary sentiment classifications. Through careful preprocessing, handling of class imbalances, and the application of a Naive Bayes classifier, the project achieves reliable sentiment predictions, providing a strong foundation for more advanced NLP tasks.
